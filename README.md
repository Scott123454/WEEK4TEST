This code models a simple takeaway ordering system and was created using TDD.  

The customer is able to select various items from a menu and then see a total cost of their order.  When the customer finishes the order the program sends a confirmation by text using the Twilio gem.  

To achieve this functionality Ruby classes, instance methods and the Twilio gem were used.
